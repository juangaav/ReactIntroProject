# ReactIntroProject

To start the database and api, type this command in the terminal (while on the folder, '../ReactIntroProject'):
docker-compose up

Inside the 'info' folder, you will also find a Postman Collection with the necessary examples to use the api correctly.
Additionally, there is also a mongo script to populate the database.
