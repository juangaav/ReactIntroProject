# ReactIntroProject

To start the database and api, type the following commands in a new terminal window (while on the folder, '../ReactIntroProject'):
npm install mongoose
docker-compose up

Inside the 'info' folder, you will also find a Postman Collection with the necessary examples to use the api correctly.
Additionally, there is also a mongo script to populate the database.

The database will be under the 'test' collection. You can easily use MongoDBCompass to connect to it using  the following url (or you can use mongosh):

mongodb://localhost:27017
